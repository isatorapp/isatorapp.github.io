Isator makes Identity and Access Management tools for system administrators and security auditors of small and medium companies. 

I had originally published the beta version on Heroku and after they stopped their free plan, I decided to rebuild the app and launch again later. If you would like to try it out, please feel free to reach out. 

Meanwhile, I also thought of writing some blog posts about some interesting things I learned during this process and how-to guides that cover things not clearly explained in the vendor's documentation. 

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/isatorapp/isatorapp.github.io/)
or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/arunsivadasan).

Thanks for reading!
