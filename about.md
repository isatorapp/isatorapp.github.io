Isator makes Identity and Access Management tools for system administrators and security auditors of small and medium companies. 

The first tool is an Active Directory auditing tool that that Azure administrators can be for Active Directory audits. I am working on building this out with a few users. This is currently in Beta and you will find more blog posts about this once its ready for a public preview. 

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/isatorapp/isatorapp.github.io/)
or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/arunsivadasan).

Thanks for reading!
